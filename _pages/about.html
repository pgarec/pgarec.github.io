I also have a strong interest in probabilistic machine learning and uncertainty quantification.</p> <p>I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics Engineering and a Master’s degree in Data Science from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a semester-long academic exchange program at Politecnico di Milano, and completed a one-year exchange program at Denmark Technical University. In the past, I had the opportunity to be an Openlab Summer Student at CERN and gained professional experience as a Data Scientist at Basetis. I also worked as a Junior Research Engineer at BSC.</p> <p>Outside of the lab, I enjoy <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/44816409" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">running</a>, cycling, and reading.</p> </body></html>
