I am a first-year PhD student in the CROMAI group at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), under the supervision of [Josep Lluis Berral](https://www.berralgarcia.com/) and [Jordi Torres](https://torres.ai/). I'm now visiting [Alaa Youssef](https://research.ibm.com/people/alaa-youssef) lab at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York.

My research focuses on improving Cloud-Edge environments using federated deep learning methods. I also have a strong interest in probabilistic machine learning and uncertainty quantification.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering and a Master's degree in Data Science from the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC). During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a semester-long academic exchange program at Politecnico di Milano, and completed a one-year exchange program at Denmark Technical University.

In the past, I had the opportunity to be an Openlab Summer Student at [CERN](https://home.cern/science/computing/cern-openlab) and gained professional experience as a Data Scientist at Basetis. I also worked as a Junior Research Engineer at BSC.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/44816409), cycling, and reading.
