I'm a first year PhD student at the "Computing Resources Orchestration and Management for AI‚Äù group at Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC), under the supervision of [Josep Lluis Berral](https://www.berralgarcia.com/) and [Jordi Torres](https://torres.ai/).

My research focuses on improving Cloud-Edge environments using federated deep learning methods. I also have a strong interest in probabilistic machine learning and uncertainty quantification.

I earned a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering and a Master's degree in Data Science from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a semester-long academic exchange program at Politecnico di Milano, and completed a one-year exchange program at Denmark Technical University. In the past, I had the opportunity to be an Openlab Summer Student at CERN and gained professional experience as a Data Scientist at Basetis. I also worked as a Junior Research Engineer at BSC.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/44816409), cycling, and reading.
