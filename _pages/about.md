I'm a firt year PhD student at the "Computing Resources Orchestration and Management for AI‚Äù group at Barcelona Supercomputer Center (BSC), under the supervision of Josep Lluis Berral and Jordi Torres.

My research addresses 

I received a BSc in Informatics Engineering and a MSc in Data Science at Polytecnic University of Catalonia (UPC). During my bachelor I did a semester-long academic exchange at Politecnico di Milano, and during my masters I did a one-year exchange at Denmark Technical University. In the past, I have been an Openlab Summer Student at CERN and I have worked as Data Scientist at Basetis, and as a Junior Research Engineer at BSC.
